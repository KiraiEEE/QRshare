- Rewrite of the app + code cleanup
- Removal of a couple dependencies to shrink the file size
- Shrink the size down from 2MB to around 1MB
- Layout change: Landscape mode and portrait mode works happily with no issues
    - Rotating the screen will also work with no issues
- Behavior changes:
    - Generates a new QR code when the text is changed. No need to tap the image anymore
    - No longer closes when resizing, leaving, or rotating the app
- App theme stuff:
    - App icon also changes with the app theme: dark/light
    - (the app also works with themed icons on LineageOS)
